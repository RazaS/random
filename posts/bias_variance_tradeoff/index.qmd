When you want to predict something one thing using another, you can let a mathematic

Let's say what you are predicting has a j shaped relationship, as follows

You can model this using a linear equation

$$
\text{MSE} = \text{Bias}^2 + \text{Variance} + \text{Irreducible Error}
$$

Where: • Bias is given by: $$
\text{Bias}^2 = \left( \mathbb{E}[\hat{f}(x)] - f(x) \right)^2
$$ • Variance is given by: $$
\text{Variance} = \mathbb{E} \left[ (\hat{f}(x) - \mathbb{E}[\hat{f}(x)])^2 \right]
$$

You can copy this directly into your LaTeX document. Let me know if you need further adjustments!
