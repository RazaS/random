## Mermaid

This is a way of creating graphs rather intuitively using text in a markdown format

I personally prefer to use it in VSCode, however it is also supported in R via the [DiagrammeR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DiagrammeR/index.html) package

You can find more examples [here](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/examples.html)

Here I give an example of an instrumental variable analysis DAG

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| 
library(DiagrammeR)

mermaid("graph LR;
    Predictor-->Outcome;
    Instrument-->Predictor;
    Confounder-.->Outcome;
    Confounder-.->Predictor;", height = "200px")

```
