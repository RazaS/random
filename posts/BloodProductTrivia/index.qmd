# Know Your Blood Products!

Understanding the technical specifications of blood products is essential for operating blood banks effectively. Here's a quick guide:

## Leukoreduced Products

-   **Definition:** To label a platelet (Plt) or red blood cell (RBC) component as *leukoreduced*, it must contain **\< 5 x 10\^6 WBCs**, achieved through a filtration process.

## Irradiated Components

-   **Radiation Requirements:**
    -   Must receive **25 grays of radiation** at the center and **\>15 grays** anywhere in the container.\
-   **Shelf Life After Irradiation (Canada):**
    -   Maximum: **28 days post-irradiation** (but not exceeding the overall maximum shelf life of 42 days).\
    -   Example:
        -   If irradiated on **Day+5** post-collection, expiry = **Day 33**.\
        -   If irradiated after **Day+14**, the expiry will remain **Day 42** (overall max shelf life).

## Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP)

-   **Definition:** Plasma must be frozen within **8 hours** of collection to be considered *fresh frozen plasma*.\
-   Plasma frozen within **24 hours** does not qualify as FFP.\
-   **Liquid Plasma:** A formulation of plasma that is **never frozen**.

## Leukoreduced Whole Blood

-   **Storage:**
    -   Stored at **1–6°C** without agitation.\
    -   Shelf life: **21 days**.\
-   **Post-Puncture Use:**
    -   If stored **above 6°C**, must be transfused within **4 hours**.\
    -   If stored at **1–6°C**, must be transfused within **24 hours**.\
-   **Future Efforts:** Research is ongoing to extend the storage period.
