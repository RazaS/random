## Elution

Elution is performed when there is an antibody on red cells which needs to be removed

#### Methods for elution of antibodies broadly include

-   Acid elution. Negatively charge antigens and antibody, releasing the antibody
-   Heat elution. Antibody binding is exothermic. When you add heat back in, binding weakens and antibodies are released into the serum
-   Other methods, such as freeze-thaw, organic solvents, microwave, ultrasound methods, are less common.

#### Reasons for elution include

-   Confirming that an antibody found in the patient serum is in fact bound to red cells, in addition (e.g. for allo-antibodies or auto-antibodies)
-   Removing the antibody to identify its specificity (for allo- or auto-antibodies with specificity)
-   Removing the antibody so that it won't interfere with other tests that need to be performed on the red cells, e.g. phenotyping for antigens requiring IAT reagents, such as for litte-s
-   Removing an antibody which you suspect might be present and causing hemolysis, e.g. an anemic neonate who may have maternal antibodies present on fetal red cells, or, a suspected delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction with antibodies present on transfused red cells
-   Removing the antibody to concentrate it for further testing, e.g. if initial reactions against panel cells are weak, or for using in a cross-match against potential donor cells (such as for low frequency antigens for which blood units may not be labeled)
-   Getting clues about drug-related antibodies, which give positive DAT but negative eluate (Â±negative IAT panel)
-   As a part of adsorption-elution procedures, which I will not go into here

#### How elutions are performed (steps here describe acid elution)

-   'Wash red cells thoroughly (e.g. by gently inverting) to remove unbound antibodies and other unbound protein (things just sitting on the red cells), i.e. things which might cause cell non-specific clumping. Washing is typically done 3-4 times using a saline solution.
-   Collect the fluid from the "**last wash**" of the red cells. The idea is that this last wash will not contain any unbound gunk (everything should've washed away in previous washes). We will use the last wash as a negative control later.
-   To your washed cells, add acid elution reagent which is usually a low pH buffer. This will cause the antibody to be released from the red cells
-   Centrifuge the mixture, collect the supernatant/eluate, this should contain any bound antibodies
-   Neutralize the eluate back to a pH which allows antibody binding to red cells
-   Centrifuge eluate to remove debris (e.g. broken red cell membranes)
-   Test the eluate against cells of interest, read off as you would a normal panel
-   Crucial step: Test the **last wash** against cells of interest at the same time, which should be negative, showing that the red cells had nothing extra. If it isn't negative, your eluate isn't valid because it means there was residual unbound-something on the red cells which could instead explain any observed agglutination, rather than your eluted antibody of interest

#### Interesting tidbits

- Positive DAT with negative eluate is a confusing scenario with a unique differential, including hypergammaglobulinema (e.g. myleoma, automimune diseases such as SLE, drugs, IVIG, uremia [?? CKD alters RBC membranes],  )
- Elution is not always successful, e.g. if the antibody is too strongly bound to the red cell, or if the red cell is too fragile and breaks during the process
- Elution is not always necessary, e.g. if the antibody is already known and the patient has a history of it, or if the antibody is not causing any problems
